# Unit-converter
A basic unit converter made with Javascript and UI made with HTML and CSS

This program can be used to convert numbers into 4 different unit bases:
> Binary: 0 and 1
> Octal: 0 to 7
> Decimal: 0 to 9
> Hexadecimal: 0 to 15 (a = 10, b = 11, c = 12, d = 13, e = 14, f = 15)

- The converter is written in JavaScript programming language and uses HTML and CSS to build a user friendly UI. This is my first programming project with a UI.
- The program allows the user to first type a number of their choice and select its original base.
- Once the user clicks the "convert" button, the number is quickly converted into its three different bases, which are shown in their respective divs.
- Additionally, the calculation steps are shown to the user as well, for educational purposes
- In case of the user typing invalid values for different bases, a div appears to warn the user
